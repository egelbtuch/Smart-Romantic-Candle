# Smart Romantic Candle & Fireplace
# Artistic Vision
Over winter break my wife and I went to a graffiti workshop in Brooklyn where we learnt about the history and beauty behind graffiti and even got to practice some of the different techniques that the pros use. It is actually a lot harder than it looks! We have been searching for another way to do more graffiti (legally, of course) at home and this project was the perfect solution.

# Materials
* Raspberry Pi 4B
* ESP32-Wrover-Dev
* 1 LED
* Breadboard
* Photoresistor
* Bunch of Wires (2 were used for capacitive touch sensors)
* 9V Lithium Ion Battery Pack
* External Monitor
* Bottle of Ros√©
* 2 Wine Glasses

# Project Overview
The project consisted of two scripts that communicated with each other serially:

* An Arduino script that ran on the ESP32 that would take in all inputs from the user and either send data serially over to the processing script or move/control the raspberry pi's mouse serially.
    
* A processing script that would take in the user input data from the ESP32 and use it to run a Graffiti Art Simulator. To switch between drawing and not drawing, the user would have to toggle the SPDT switch (which controlled the left clicker of the mouse). To move the spray-paint can around the canvas the user would use the joystick. To clear the canvas the user would push the joystick's push-button. To change the color of the paint, the user would use the two push-buttons. One button was programmed to subtract 1 from the current hue value while the other would add 1 to the current hue value.n it would rain money symbols on fire.

# Running the Simulator
In order to run this program, you first need to setup the hardware. Start by plugging in the ESP32 into the breadboard's GPIO at the top of the board. Then plug in the 2 push-buttons, the SPDT switch and the analog joystick into the GPIOS of your ESP32. Do this without obstructing your inputs with wires. Make sure that you plug the push-buttons and the switch into digital GPIO pins. Once the hardware is setup, edit any input pin numbers in the JoystickMouseControl.ino file to the GPIO pin numbers you used for your inputs. Then, load the file onto the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE. Open the serial monitor to check if your ESP32 is printing the proper values for your inputs. Then connect the ESP32 via a serial USB cable to the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. Finally, run the processing script, HI.pde, on the Raspberry Pi and start painting!

# Communicating Over Bluetooth

For the ESP32 to send data serially the script loaded on it must include `Serial.begin(9600)` in the setup. Everytime within the script you want to write data to the serial you use `Serial.write()`. To give your Raspberry Pi access to this data you must connect your Pi with a USB to your ESP32. In Processing, you have to add `import processing.serial.*` and `Serial myPort` to the top of your script. Then in setup you add `String portName = Serial.list()[1]` and `myPort = new Serial(this, portName, 9600)` specifing both the serial port you want to access and the baud rate being used to send the data. Then you can access the data coming in with something like `String val = myPort.readStringUntil('\n')`, depending on what the application is.

# Technical Issues
My main difficulty was figuring out how to use the joystick and a push-button as a USB mouse on the raspberry pi. After figuring that out I realized that the delays between each of my input's data-writes to serial was slowing the movements of the joystick mouse but without the delays the processing script was not reacting quick enough for the simulator to work smoothly. After a few iterations I found a good medium where neither thing was reacting too slowly to my inputs. Another issue that came up was that my 
raspberry pi was getting very hot and therefore I decided not to put it inside the enclosure.
